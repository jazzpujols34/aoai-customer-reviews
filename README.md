# AOAI Customer Review Analysis
This repository contains a Python script that uses the Azure OpenAI service to analyze customer reviews. 

The script reads a CSV file containing customer reviews, uses the OpenAI GPT-3 model to analyze the sentiment, summarize the content, generate keywords, and draft a reply message for each review. The results are then saved into a new CSV file.

The code is based on the article "[Analyze Customer Reviews wit Azure OpenAI Service](https://medium.com/geekculture/analyze-customer-reviews-with-azure-openai-service-e46b18ff08c7)".
