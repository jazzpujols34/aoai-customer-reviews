After initial frustration of trying to find a FAST way to get this resolved (ASOS no phone number and a chat box that kept disappearing unless you were like lightning on keyboard?), I liaised with Donique who resolved this quickly, re-ordering to be delivered within 4 working days.  This has minimized my delivery anxiety, as it is a present for my daughter.  Friendly and efficient service overall and providing it arrives (it was confirmed it was in stock) with watch inside(!), I will be a happy customer again. Sad state of affairs, that people (presumably at packing stage) steal, when the rest of us work hard to earn money to buy these treats. ASOS so far, so good!",Positive," Despite initial frustration, ASOS's Donique provided friendly and efficient service that resolved the issue quickly and ensured a delivery within 4 working days, avoiding Christmas stress and keeping the customer happy."," ASOS, Fast Resolution, Christmas Stress","We apologize that your Vivienne Westwood order did not come with a watch inside.
